# Visual Image Rename

A simple application used to rename image files. It was created as a realization of a request from my friend (who was also responsible for this and not another look and style ).


After loading the catalog, you can change the order of the images in the list, on which the final numbering depends. Each photo can also be given a unique name (but the number will always be added by the application). To insert a serial number anywhere in the file name, put a `#` character.
